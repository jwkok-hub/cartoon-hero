		<h2>About Javier Baez</h2>
		<p>Javier Baez is a MLB All-Star shortstop for the New York Mets. He was recently traded there from his former baseball team, the Chicago Cubs, whom he helped win the 2016 World Series Championship. He is one of my favorite athletes of all time because of his athleticism and drive he shows each game he plays.</p>
